# Face-Attendance

This project allows teachers to track attendance of a classroom by having students enter their name and then upload a picture of them on the website. It uses an API called "Face++" and, after capturing the image of the student, this program stores the file of the student as a jpg and compares it to a source image to ensure the correct student was checked in. The teacher is in control of uploading the source images, has the ability to manually remove student from the "checked list", and can check which students haven't been checked in at any given point.
